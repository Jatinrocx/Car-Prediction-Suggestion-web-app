# Car-Prediction-Suggestion-web-app
Namaste, Everyone!
I created this ML based car suggest and price predict application. The website is fully functional and useable in real life. This is easy to use. I used agile methodology for this project as mentioned as part of this program. I divided my whole task into four weeks. I started completing my tasks as sprint wise that helped in smooth learning and building the product.
Features
Suggest cars based on categorised specifications
Predict negotiable price to sell or buy second hand car
Compare engine specifications with other users
Depict correlation statistics among car specification parameters
Website Features Design and flow


Website Layout
Homepage constitutes the basic features of applications mentioned in the navigation bar. The basic functioning of these features is: 

Buy Feature (Home >> Buy)
Suggest best suited model based upon user fed specifications
Model can be suggested based on budget as a priority parameter
